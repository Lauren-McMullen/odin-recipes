# Welcome to the **College Cookbook** recipe website. 

This project is a part of the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a full stack web development course.

The recipes project is designed to practice and demonstrate skills in **HTML**. In later course modules, CSS will be applied to the website.
