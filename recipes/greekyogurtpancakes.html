        <h2>A new way to pancake!</h2>
        <p>
            For many of us, a good pancake breakfast envokes the dreamt nostalgia of weekend mornings and summer vacation. Luckily, pancakes
            can also be a cost effective and delicious dinner for students. These protein-packed greek yogurt pancakes use only 8 common ingredients
            and take less than 30 minutes to whip up. Add chocolate chips, blueberries, or any other mix-in you want for an extra falvour punch!
        </p>

        <h2>What you'll need (ingredients)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup plain greek yogurt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large griddle or frying pan to low-medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt & sugar.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl whisk the eggs. Then whisk in the yogurt and milk.</li>
            <li>Gently fold the wet ingredients into the flour mixture using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. The batter will be a little lumpy.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease your frying pan/griddle with oil or non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>For each pancake, pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the griddle. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until you see a few air bubbles on the uncooked side. 
                Flip and continue to fry for 2-3 minutes on the second side or until golden.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the rest of the batter.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with fruit, syrup, whipped cream or whatever toppings you prefer.</li>
        </ol>
